Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The goal of this code is to make an app to diagnose symptoms of either a copd or asthma through a series of yes or no questions.
 
Known Issues:
The code will not work when the back arrow is pressed to go to a previous page. The allergy or cold count will be added again and the percentages will not add up in the end.
Also, this code does not have enough questions or credibility to be used as a diagnostic tool.

Ignore this error message if you see it using the javaScript console: Error with Permissions-Policy header: Origin trial controlled feature not enabled: 'interest-cohort'.
